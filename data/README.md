I downloaded these by datasets hand from the following sources:

- The elections data are from [MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017, U.S. President 1976--2020](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/42MVDX). This doesn't need to be updated ever. 
- The COVID vaccination data are from [COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). This should be periodically updated (perhaps something to automate).
