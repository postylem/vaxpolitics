I downloaded these by datasets hand from the following sources:

- The [elections dataset](./1976-2020-president.csv) is from [MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017, U.S. President 1976--2020](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/42MVDX). This doesn't need to be updated ever. 
- The [COVID vaccination dataset](covid19_vaccinations_in_the_united_states.csv) is from CDC, downloaded from [COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). This should be periodically updated (perhaps something to automate).
- The [COVID cases/testing/deaths dataset](united_states_covid19_cases_deaths_and_testing_by_state.csv) is from CDC, downloaded from [United States COVID-19 Cases Deaths and Testing by State](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_casesper100klast7days). This should be periodically updated (perhaps something to automate).
